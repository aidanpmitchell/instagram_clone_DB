# Instagram Clone Database
## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a clone of a basic Instagram database. The objective was to understand the underlying structure of a social media database and to utilize MySQL for database management and data querying. The project was divided into four main phases: designing the database schema, coding the database creation, populating the database with mock data, and answering business-related queries using MySQL.

## Technologies Used
- MySQL
- QuickDBD

## Phase 1: Database Design
Initially, a comprehensive database schema was designed to mimic Instagram's typical functionalities. This included tables for users, photos, comments, likes, follower relationships, unfollows, and hashtags. The schema was visualized using QuickDBD, and the design ensures efficient data retrieval.
